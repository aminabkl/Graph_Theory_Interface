					Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree
					data structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree
					and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks
					until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it. The algorithm
					does this until the entire graph has been explored.

				<p>
					Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
					tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some
					arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search
					key'[1]), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth
					prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

				<p>
					In computer science, Prim's (also known as Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a
					greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted
					undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms
					a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the
					edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building
					this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at
					each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to
					another vertex.
